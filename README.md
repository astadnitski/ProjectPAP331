# PAP331 Project Work

- Look for background processes in Appendix A of Pythia documentation?

- Which channels should be switched on?

- Explain the Drell-Yan and ttbar processes with Feynman diagrams

-- See image

- Is there an option for  HLT DoubleIsoMu20 eta2p1 in Pythia or is it just what the parameters for the trigger are called?

-- Just what the parameters are called

- What does part 2B mean (each entry in the histogram corresponds to a correct amount of cross-section)?

-- Use Pythia to calculate the cross-section (when you simulate the events, you always get it) (calculated anyway for part 1)

- Part 2C: background plot is both backgrounds?

-- Subtract plot with background from plot with background and signal to get signal plot

Should we limit mass phase space?

Advice:

Use Landau distribution for fits. Or try Gaussian or something it's a good approximation. For the signal Breit-Wigner is probably best

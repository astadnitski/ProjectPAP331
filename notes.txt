NOTES

// Delta R = sqrt((Delta phi)^2 + (Delta eta)^2) 
// TLorentzVector makes sure that phi_1 - phi_2 is in the allowed range
// This method is in Root: can use Root functions

// For part 2: save event ID and also make a tree for charged pions for that event

// Instead of using 2 trees, use 1 tree with different branches

// Efficiency should be (N passing HLT) / (All e.g. 10000)

// For invariant mass: use TLorentzVector & add up

// Consider config files for portability

// Problem 3
// Why wouldn't believe us?
// Statistical significance: check sigma
// Only some backgrounds on, most ignored
// Not detector simulation - can't be compared to actual detector data
// Optimize selection

// Normalization requires cross section (sigma) and integrated luminosity
